// Note: The current handler implementation has architectural limitations that make
// comprehensive unit testing difficult:
// 1. Handlers directly use the global engine.Engine database connection
// 2. Error handling doesn't return early, causing execution to continue after errors
// 3. No dependency injection makes mocking database calls impossible
//
// These tests focus on what can be tested within these constraints.

		// because they depend on the global database engine which is not initialized
		// during tests, and error handling doesn't prevent continued execution.

		// This test serves as documentation of the testing limitations
		// and would typically be addressed by:
		// 1. Dependency injection for database connections
		// 2. Proper error handling with early returns
		// 3. Interface-based design for easier mocking
